Welcome!

It's a pleasure to have you here
📝 What it consists of:
Welcome to a new project! This time, we will scrape data from Facua to compare six supermarkets: Alcampo, Carrefour, Dia, Eroski, Hipercor, and Mercadona. Within these, we will select three categories: olive oil, sunflower oil, and milk.

Project Objectives:
Data Scraping: Extract detailed information about all available products on the FACUA website for each of the listed supermarkets.

Database Storage: Create an SQL database to store the collected information in a structured manner.

Data Analysis:

Price Comparison between Supermarkets
Price Evolution Analysis
Anomaly Detection
Price Dispersion Analysis
Average Price Comparison
Data Visualization
🗂️ Project Structure
We have created an environment named Webscraping for this project.

Results and Conclusions

We observed that the most offered product is milk across all supermarkets.

When looking at each supermarket individually, we notice a similar trend, with sunflower oil having the least offer.

Regarding average prices, Eroski would be more convenient for purchasing sunflower oil based on its price history.

Concerning maximum prices for sunflower oil, Carrefour would be the least recommended supermarket, but packs of products should also be taken into account.

The maximum price for sunflower oil would recommend Carrefour based on the maximum prices.
